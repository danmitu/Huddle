This is an Oregon State University capstone project for Colton Herinckx, Dan Mitu, and Gerald Gordon Ashlock II. The objective was to create a clone of [Meetup](www.meetup.com) with an iOS App client. This repository is the iOS app. You can find the backend [here](https://github.com/herinckc/cs467-huddle-project). This app represents a proof of concept. It was created by three, part time students in 7 weeks.
